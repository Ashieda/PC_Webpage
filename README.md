# PC_Webpage
A small project to work on my responsive web development skills.

This page will be a fake webpage for a real group - my World of Warcraft guild, Primal Chaos. I'll include information that I use for the guild itself, including raid schedules, guild rules, and some screenshots of boss kills we've gotten in the last few years.
